# Ray Tracing In One Week in Rust

this is my implementation of [Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing in One Week](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) with Rust language.

In this repo, I'll try my best to make full use of Rust's features to fulfill this mission. I expect the whole period to be within one month.

## Installation and Execution

### Clone the source code

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Hyiker/ray_tracing_in_one_week_rust.git
```

### pick the module and run it

```bash
cd ./ray_tracing_in_one_week_rust/output_an_image
cargo run > ../resources/res.ppm
```
